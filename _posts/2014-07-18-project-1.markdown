description: Views in CiviCRM Dashlets is a <strong>Drupal</strong> module that allows one to create a dashlet containing a Drupal View. That is right, in addition to CiviCRM reports you can use the power of Drupal Views to create a customizable experience. This opens grand new opportunities to use our imagination and drive to strengthen the bond between Drupal and CiviCRM. A majority of the functionality of Views is currently at your fingertips, with further enhancements on the horizon.<div>
